Weather Shield Example

Date: November 16th, 2013
License: This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this and we meet someday (Beerware license).

Much of this is based on Mike Grusin's USB Weather Board code: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10586

This code reads all the various sensors (wind speed, direction, rain gauge, humidty, pressure, light, batt_lvl)
and reports it over the serial comm port. This can be easily routed to an datalogger (such as OpenLog) or
a wireless transmitter (such as Electric Imp).

Measurements are reported once a second but windspeed and rain gauge are tied to interrupts that are
calcualted at each report.

This example code assumes the GPS module is not used.
